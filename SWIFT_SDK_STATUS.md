# Swift SDK Testing Results

## API Key Used
`GrpVNMY8BlRUR3pAH3VlqrM8NPRTXNWphLGdNqCvrdIYroqQ`

## Test Results Summary

### ‚úÖ Working Features

1. **Authentication**
   - API key authentication works correctly
   - Headers are properly sent: `X-Hume-Api-Key`

2. **TTS API**
   - Voice listing works (200 OK)
   - Returns voices like "Colton Rivers", "Dungeon Master", etc.
   - Voice provider must be specified as `HUME_AI`

3. **EVI API**
   - Tool creation works (201 Created)
   - Tool listing endpoint responds (200 OK)
   - Configuration listing endpoint responds (200 OK)

4. **Expression Measurement API**
   - Job listing endpoint responds (200 OK)

### ‚ùå Issues Found

1. **TTS API Issues**
   - Simple synthesis returns data but has decoding error (missing optional fields in Snippet)
   - Voice names like "ITO", "KORA" don't exist - must use actual voice names from the list
   - Format encoding needs `type` field, not `format`
   - Audio format must follow specific structure

2. **EVI API Issues**
   - Built-in configs URL has encoding issue (`%3F` instead of `?`)
   - Response missing `total_items` field (need to make optional)
   - Configuration prompt must be an object, not a string
   - Tool update requires name field even for description-only updates

3. **Expression Measurement API Issues**
   - Language model doesn't accept `emotions` field
   - Job listing response missing `status` field in array items
   - Need to fix model configuration structure

### üîß Fixes Needed

1. **Response Models**
   - Make pagination fields optional (`total_items`, `total_pages`, etc.)
   - Fix Snippet model to have optional time fields
   - Fix job status field in batch job responses

2. **Request Models**
   - Remove `emotions` field from Language configuration
   - Fix prompt structure for EVI configurations
   - Ensure all required fields are included in updates

3. **URL Encoding**
   - Fix query parameter encoding for built-in configs

## Working Examples

### TTS Voice Listing
```swift
let voices = try await tts.listVoices(provider: .humeAI, pageSize: 10)
// Returns: Colton Rivers, Dungeon Master, Female Meditation Guide, etc.
```

### EVI Tool Creation
```swift
let tool = CreateToolRequest(
    name: "search_web",
    description: "Search the web",
    parameters: "{...}",
    fallbackContent: "I'll search for that."
)
let created = try await evi.createTool(tool)
// Successfully creates tool with ID
```

## Recommendations

1. The Swift SDK structure is solid and follows best practices
2. Most issues are related to API response/request format mismatches
3. With the fixes identified above, the SDK should be fully functional
4. Consider adding integration tests that mock the actual API responses

## Next Steps

1. Fix the identified model issues
2. Add proper error handling for missing fields
3. Update examples to use correct voice names and formats
4. Add more comprehensive documentation about API requirements
